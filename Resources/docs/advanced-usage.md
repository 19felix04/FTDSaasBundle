## Mailing

You can template html-mails, send by the application, by setting mail templates (seen in [Configuration Reference](#configuration-reference.md)).
If mail template isn't set or the value is 'false', the system won't send any mail.

Well, you can translate the mail subjects too. Copy the parts of the translation files (`Resources/translations/ftd_saas.en.yaml`) and write your own mail subjects.
